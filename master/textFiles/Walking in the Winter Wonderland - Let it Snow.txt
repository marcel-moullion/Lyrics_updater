Verse 1

Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening

A beautiful sight We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Verse 2

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird

He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

Chorus 1

In the meadow we can build a snowman
We'll pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say Are you married We'll say No man
But you can do the job while you're in town

Verse 3

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire

To face unafraid the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

Chorus 2

Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful

And since we've no place to go
Let it snow let it snow let it snow

Verse 4

Man it doesn't show signs of stoppin
And I brought me some corn for poppin

The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow let it snow let it snow

Tag 1

The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow let it snow let it snow

Let it snow let it snow let it snow
Let it snow let it snow

Tag 2

To face unafraid the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
