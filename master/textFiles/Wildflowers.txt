Verse 1

Like a tree rooted deep
Your love is steady through the seasons

Like a rose that unfolds
Your heart for me is always open

Chorus 1

Your love is amazing
I can hardly contain it

It's the greatest thing I've found
And Your love doesn't waiver

Now and forever
It's the greatest thing I've found

Verse 2

Like a bird soaring high
Your love for me, it has no boundary

Like a child running wild
Your love is dancing all around me

Bridge 1

Planted deep and taking hold
From the soil, Your life unfolds

Some things only love can grow
Blooming free without control

Colors of Your love explode like
Wildflowers in my soul

Chorus 2

Cause Your love is amazing
I can hardly contain it

It's the greatest thing I've found
And Your love doesn't waiver

Both now and forever
It's the greatest thing I've found
