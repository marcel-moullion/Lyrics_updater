Verse 1

I remember when I called Your Name

There I knew I'd never be the same

Love came rushing to this heart of mine

Like You'd waited for this all my life

Verse 2

I remember when I learnt to pray

Close to You I found my hiding place

Here Your Spirit works within my soul

And Your presence keeps me wanting more

Verse 3

When I think upon Your wounded hands

And how You began our great romance

I will take Your bread and take Your wine

To remember Lord Your sacrifice

Verse 4

Now a servant for Your kingdom come

Where You’re leading me is where I’ll run

Jesus I can be Your hands and feet

May my life remember You my King

Chorus 1

I need You more than anything

Bridge 1

Lord here I am
I’m reaching out

I will lay me down and surrender

I’ll sing Your Name
I’ll sing it loud

You are all I want now forever

Tag 1

Lord here I am

Verse 5

And the day shall come when I will rise

Finally I'll see You face to face

With the heavens I will glorify

Crown You Lord for all eternity
